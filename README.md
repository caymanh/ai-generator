 ### Description

 AI Image Generator is a React-based application that enables users to generate an image via OpenAI's DALL-E model using a prompt and share it with the community. The app has two pages - Home and Create Post.

 The Home page showcases a collection of imaginative and visually stunning images generated by users via DALL-E AI. Users can also utilize the Search bar to search for images.
 
 The Create Post page enables users to enter their name and a prompt to generate an image. It also allows users to share the generated image to the community and showcase it on the Home page.
